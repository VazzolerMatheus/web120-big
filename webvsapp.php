<!--                <h2 class="subheader" id="one">Web vs App</h2>-->

                <p>Nowdays, most of the people in the world possess a mobile phone. According to statista Number of mobile phone users worldwide in 2019 is reaching 4.68 billion. No doubt that if you are creating something for you business there is a main question you should ask yourself. Is better to build an app or a website? There are pros and cons in both ways.</p>

                <p>For applications, they are way more expensive to build because they are platform specific. It means that depending on the mobile system your end user uses, more work should be done. You would have to create two complete systems for both Android and IOS, which are the two most popular mobile’s operational systems. On the other hand, the user experience in this case is way better. Building an app for a specific system means that it will load and work way faster than any website. Moreover, by building an app you can take advantage of many features of the mobile phones, like opening the contact list, using the camera and etc.</p>

                <p>For websites, it is the other way around. Websites work through a navigator and is loaded by the server that the website is hosted. It means that the same website will work in every single device, which in other words mean a much cheaper development process. On the other hand, websites lack one thing that apps do not: speed and features. By only having a website, having internet connection is a must for the end users to reach your website. Also, the mobile phone’s features you can integrate with you website is limited.</p>

                <p>Websites and Apps are two great ways to reach the end user. It’s up to us which one to pick. If you need something simple that spreads the message you are trying to convey, go for the website. Now, if you need something more complex that would need mobile features to work, go for the app.</p>
