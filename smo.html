           <p>The first question is: what is social media optimization? Also known as SMO, social media optimization is basically the optimization of brands throughout social media. In other words, is making sure companies' websites and social media profiles are optimized for social media users through its platform. Have you ever opened a third party link through Facebook and the webpage just did not work or look good through your mobile display? So, that page was not optimized for social media.</p>
           
            <p>Social media has a massive number of users and potential clients. Social media is part of our daily lives, Instagram, facebook, twitter, Snapchat, and many more platforms are names that we know and recognize even just by the logo. To show how massive Social media is today, a poll from Pew Research Center shows that 86% of U.S. Adults Aged between 18 and 29 are social media users. Moreover, 69% of them use it at least once a day. So, as web developers, the awareness of optimizing websites for social media is a must.</p>
           
           <p>As web developers, there are some best practices to help improve the social media optimization of websites.</p>
