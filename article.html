       <p>Compared to years ago, our lives today are super easy. One of the factors that makes our everyday life easy like this is the Web. Through the web, we can talk to tons of friends at the same time no matter how distant they are from us, we can order food, rent a hotel room, plan a trip, watch videos and our favorite shows, check our bank status and even pay bills, amazing right? Not for everybody. According to the world bank, 15% of the global population experiences some form of disability. This means that for one billion people, their life is not as easy as it should be. So how we as web developers can help them to have the commodity of using the web just like the rest of the world? The answer is simple. It is called accessibility.</p>
       
       <p>Fortunately, today we already have a Web Accessibility Standards created by W3C, that help us as web developers to make websites accessible to everybody. According to them, the disabilities that affects the access to the web are auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual. For each one of those, there is a way to make the user life easier. W3C lists 3 different types of components that put the web together, and for each one of those, there is a standard for web developers to follow to make the web accessible, and here they are.</p>
       
       <p>First is the Web content, it refers to any part of the website, including, images, forms, multimedia, texts and etc. Here is the link to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" title="Link to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines page">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p> 
       
       <p>The second one is the User agents, it is the software that people use to access the web, like desktop browsers, voice browsers, mobile phones, assistive technology and etc. Here is the link to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/" title="Link to User Agent Accessibility Guidelines page">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
       
       <p>The third one is the Authoring tools, it is the software developers use to create all the web content, like code editors, databases and other tools. Here is the link to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/" title="Link to Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines page">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
       
       <p>To make more clear how it the accessibility works, here is a video from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI):</p>
